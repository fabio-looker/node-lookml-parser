# Changelog

⚡ indicates a breaking change

- v2
	- ⚡ removed the `_name` property on objects.
	- Added a `_type` property on all objects
	- As a replacement for `_name`, added multiple `_<type>: <name>` properties (e.g. `{ ... , "_type": "join", "_join": "users", "_explore": "orders"}` )
	- Added a `_n` property which gives the lexical position of the object in the original text
- v2.2
	- The return now contains model objects which have recursively included other referenced files' contents
	- In interactive mode, the output is slightly more compact
- v3.0
	- ⚡ yesno fields are now mapped to true/false
	- Added conditional comment feature. The CLI flag is --conditional-comment=FOO or -c FOO
- v4.0
	- ⚡ The grammar now recognizes attributes whose type starts with 'expr' as doubleSemiBlock-valued. If you were previously using such a naming convention in conditional-comment based LookML, you will need to use a new naming convention, or use doubleSemiBlock syntax. E.g. `expression_custom_filter: ${field} ;;`
	- ⚡ The grammar no longer ignores leading whitespace in a doubleSemiBlock.
- v5.0
	- ⚡⚡⚡ For simplicity and reduced output size, the output no longer includes the array version of collections of named objects. Only the object version, keyed by name, is returned.
- v5.1
	- Added the ability to control the output format of the files collection
- v6.0
	- ⚡ The _file_rel property has changed slightly and no longer includes the file's extension
	- Added a 'none' file output mode for use cases that only care about assembled models
	- Added support for subdirectories and corresponding include statements (Does not yet support remote imports)
- v6.1
	- Added a `cwd` parameter to conveniently run the parser relative to a specified working directory
- v6.2
	- More consistent handling of manifest file across `file-output` modes
- v6.3
	- Support for new LookML syntax: refinements, and maplists (e.g. `filters:[field:">0"]`)
- v6.4 (should have been major change)
	- ⚡ "metadata" naming convention changed. Metadata properties now start with `$` rather than `_`
	- ⚡ Nodes in the JSON representation no longer contain their own name in a variadic property name, it is now always in `$name`
	- The parser can now capture text metadata into the `$strings` property, supporting use cases such as comment analysis, whitespace analysis and round-tripping/generation. Strings metadata is removed by default for the CLI, but can be exposed with the `transform` parameter.
	- [beta] Ability to generate LookML strings from JSON data containing the captured string metadata. Only exposed as a module export from the `generate` subdirectory
- v6.5
	- More permissive model file naming. Any character now accepted in model names.
	- Added guards against prototype pollution
- v6.6
	- NPM ignore test-projects, which was growing in size and is normally not useful to consumers of the package
	- Added the ability to resolve extensions/refinements within models, by passing `transformations:{applyRefinementsExtensions:true}` to parseFiles
